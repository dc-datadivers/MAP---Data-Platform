# Cost management exports

CSVs can be generated on a regular basis and copied to the audit storage account to aid in cost management. Power BI reports can be written from these CSVs to provide detailed cost analysis.


# Schedule exports

Go to **Cost Management** for the subscription and select **Exports**



Select **Add**

Create a new export for month to date costs.



If you get an error about the resource provider Microsoft.CostManagementExports, wait for a few minutes and try again. Otherwise, register the resource provider under Subscription / Resource Providers

Create another export for monthly costs.
